# thisIsNot
In theater or performance, there is always a curtain separating audience and performer; a physical obstruction that isolate the two. But then there also exists that fourth wall put into the mix. The omnipotent audience then "sees" what it seems. The image presented is intended to be "that is". But is what is given really "what is"? Is what we are seeing in whatever context truly what "is"?

Imagine someone tells you, "your world view is a completely objective presentation of what surrounds you." Do you believe them? Is what you see the truth? Is what you are told as is what it seems?

***thisIsNot*** poses questions of *what is*, *who is*, as well as in the negative and asking questions of what we choose to accept as is and what we choose to deny: What are those unchallenged assumptions that exist in our daily lives? What are the outright refusals of acknowledgement that we decide to accept? What are the associations we allow ourselves to be apart of?

Is *this* really? This is? Is it safe to accept and agree that this is? This is not what it seems. This is not what I feel. This is not what I think. This is not what is real. This is not what I know. This is not what you feel. This is not what you are. This is not.
## Artwork details
***thisIsNot*** was an artwork produced by [Darin Buzon]() and exhibited for the UCLA Design | Media Arts Undergraduate Exhibition *Breaking the Rules*, from 17 January 2019 to 1 February 2019.

Its installation source code was programmed in Processing with libraries and code snippets taken from [Dan Schiffman](https://shiffman.net/)'s [Coding Train tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZMlWHdcy8hAGDy6IaoxUKf).

The physical media was created from cut OSB and square dowells, drilled together and finished with Gaffer tape. The form itself was inspired from the Yale School of Art Graphic Design 2018 MFA Thesis Exhibition: [An Image Going to Work](http://an-image-going-to-work.net/).
## Repository details
